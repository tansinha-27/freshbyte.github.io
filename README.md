A desktop based website-"Freshbyte". Made as an attempt to compile basic information and doubts which beginners have when stepping into computer science, a problem which I had faced as a fresher with no prior background.
As it was my first proper project, I have mainly focused on the UI/UX of the website.
Tech used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Basic JS
