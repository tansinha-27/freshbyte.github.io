FRESHBYTE- A guide for freshers stepping into computer science
A desktop based website-"Freshbyte". Made as an attempt to compile basic information and doubts which beginners have when stepping into computer science, a problem which I feel I had faced initially as a fresher with no prior background.
As it was my first proper project, my main focus was on the UI/UX of the website.
Tech used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Basic JS
