    <div class="body1">
     <p>   Imagine what all you use everyday;from phones to TV's to laptops.Each and every thing we interact with in the 21st century has amazing features and do things which we couldn't even think about a few years ago. <br>
        That's the beauty of this field.
        <br><br>
        You have the power to bring any idea of yours to life, to help and entertain people,and to explore with different technologies.

    <p>Nobody could have imagined GPS systems so advanced that they could map every route. Nobody could have imagined doing their whole shopping just by the click of a button.Nobody could have imagined ordering food from an application, eliminating the need to talk to or to interact with the restaurant itself.Prediction models, voice assistants , highly accurate image finders have all become possible due to technology and computers.We are moving towards a future where human dependency is minimum, and the users needs at the maximum. </p>

    At a more basic level,
    you can code simple programs like a calculator, or make something complex like a compiler. It's fun, helps you to improve your logical thinking and problem solving. You can team up with your friends to solve interesting questions, come up with an original working protoype for a hackathon or just contribute in making existing programs better. You get to interact with a lot of like minded people like you , and collaborate to make fun stuff! 
    You can make cool apps and jazzy websites, you can go into hacking, you can make devices like your own AI assistant,develop games. The possibilities are endless.
</p>
<br>
<p> I hope you're convinced now to start your journey. You can create , work on and redefine things which you always wanted to . There are tons of resources available on the Internet and everywhere else, you just need to have the mindset to learn.
    In Computer Science, each and every day is new.<b>Think Big, Think Impossible!</b>
