            <h1>DOMAINS TO EXPLORE</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="body1">
        <p>Since there are so fields which you can dive into, Computer Science has been classified into specific domains. Each domain is a subset of Computer Science, and explores a certain area.One needs to have specific skillsets and tools in order to gain expertise of a particular domain.
            <br><br>
            Here are the major domains which you can explore:
            
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="sub">
                MACHINE LEARNING
            </div>
                <p>Machine Learning (ML) makes <b>email filtering, speech recognition, movie recommendations , self driving cars and tons of other things</b> possible.<b>It is the method of using predefined datasets to make predictions , and is considered a subset of Artificial Intelligence</b>.It eliminates the use of hard coded programming and human supervision, and helps computers to make decisions on their own based on some information which is available to them.
                    <br><br>
                    For instance, Netflix always seems to know what you want to watch! Their recommendation system model is highly personalised and updated. It analyses the movies you've watched before, the movies you spent less time on, actors who you watch frequently and many other factors, to make a decision and suggest you movies similar to those you watch. <b>This helps Netflix to stay at the top of their game ,and expand their business.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    ML uses <b>data analysis, statistics , predictive analysis , algorithms like regression,k-means , Decision Tree  extensively.The prerequisite language  is Python/R</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    It is clear that<b> ML is the future</b> and there is tons to do in this domain. ML helps to <b>improve business decisions, personalise experiences and reveal hidden patterns, thus resulting in a better user experience.</b> Companies get a deeper understanding of the market by collecting and utilizing data provided by the public, which helps them to come up with better and more effective solutions.
                    ML is visibly one of the hottest domains right now!

                <div class="sub">
                    ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>AI has achieved things which we as humans, could not even have imagined about years ago;<b>talking robots, applications which predict routes, facial recognition, personalised voice assistants.</b> It is the <b> development of human like skills and thought process in computer systems, unlike conventional computer intelligence where everything has to be explicitly programmed and looked over by people.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    AI <b>combines ML, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing(NLP),Speech recognition, Artifical Neural Networks and many other methods.</b>It draws upon many fields such as mathematics, probablity, statistics, philosphy, reasoning , learning. It believes in making <b>machines capable and independant as accurately as possible </b>, which some people believe might be the cause for mass unemployment in the future.
                    <br><br>
                    Broadly, it can be classified into three types:
                    <br>
                    1.<b> Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):</b>These have narrow abilities and do not have a very wide scope. They is designed for a particular specific task (eg:speech recognition), and perform it extremely accurately.Machine Learning falls into this category.<br>
                    This is the only type which we have deeply explored and achieved success in! 
                    <br>Example-Siri, prediction tools
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2.<b> Artificial General Intelligence(AGI):</b>These systems have capabilities comparable to humans .They mimic human intelligence and thinking, and almost behave as humans do.It would be possible to use their intelligence to solve any problem, and make rational decisions.<br>It is more difficult to achieve AGI as it requires the ability to process emotions, beliefs etc. along with many other things.
                    <br><br>
                    3.<b>Artificial Super Intelligence(ASI):</b> It exists in theory right now. ASI refers to intelligence which goes far beyond human behaviour and intelligence; superintelligence.Think of humans which are perfect at everything, can perform tasks at an extremely fast rate , and have greater memory, along with superhuman capability to make decisons and solve problems. This is what ASI would aim to achieve.
                    <br>
                    This type is basically what sci-fi movies are made of!
                    <br><br>
                    It's clear<b> the oppurtunities and scope in this domain are endless.</b> Companies are investing heavily in AI because it comprises of what the future of technology would look like.It is definitely <b>a field which has a room for a lot of research and development of interesting tech. Look out, here comes the future!</b>
                </p>

                <div class="sub">
                    WEB/APP DEVELOPMENT 
                </div>
                <br>
               <p> The name itself pretty much gives away what it is. Web or <b>website development refers to the development of websites/web apps from scratch.</b>Websites are generally a <b>collection of web pages used to display information in an attractive and interesting manner, in the form of text, images, buttons, videos , links .</b> They can be made using <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript along with different frameworks like React JS, Angular , Django, jQuery etc.</b>Or if you want a simpler, quicker yet more limited approach, you can go to sites like Wordpress where websites can be made on predefined templates.<br> It only<b> requires frontend. Eg: NDTV</b>
                   <br><br>
                   On the other hand,<b> Web Applications are softwares which don't only display information, but also interacts with the users. It requires both frontend and backend.</b> Users can <b>manipulate data, fetch data, update data</b> and more.The site interacts with <b>servers, API's, and databases.</b> It requires many more skills and tends to be more complex.<br>
                <b>Eg:Amazon, Paypal</b>
                   <br><br>
                <b>App development refers to development of applications for devices like smartphones and tablets from scratch.</b> It performs certain <b>functions according to the users needs, and are incredibly fun to interact with.</b>Many steps such as <b>research, designing, prototyping are followed,</b> to come up with a succesful app.<br>
                   For <b>Android OS, the preferred language is Kotlin/Java.</b>For <b>Apple iOS,Swift in generally used. Flutter is an open source software development kit (SDK) which uses Dart as a programming languages, and can be used for both iOS and Android.</b><br><br>
                   Both <b>web and app development are evergreen</b> , and in today's time it's become necessary to atleast know the basics of each field. The <b>dependance of society on websites, web apps and apps is huge and the market is rising.</b>You can do a lot of creative stuff, come up with innovative ideas and <b> who knows what you might create!</b>

            <br>
            <p>The amount of information with which we trust the Internet with these days, <b>it's very well possible that every single detail about us gets exposed anyday.</b>Ever wondered how our personal details, preferences , passwords , money , information etc. are kept securely ?<br> That's where <b>cybersecurity comes in. It refers to a set of skills and tools that keep the information entrusted by the users secure, and inaccessible to third parties.</b><br><br>
            <b> Ethical hacking is a domain pursued by white-hat hackers ,hackers whose intentions are not malicious.</b> Rather, they<b> help companies to test their software and find out loopholes, so that they can be resolved and the system strengthened.</b> They <b>test against all the security breaches, and follow an offensive approach</b> instead of defensive.<br>
        <b>Black-hat hackers are those who intentions are to harm a person/company by hacking their records </b>to obtain valuable information, which they <b>later use for harmful purposes.</b><br><br>
              Cybersecurity <b>is very much in demand these days.</b>It's a<b> vast subject requiring in depth knowledge of network and computer systems.</b><b>Heavy rewards are awarded to ethical hackers</b> who find <b>bugs</b> in softwares.One of the most promising domains, if you wanna be like  the hackers you see in movies, this is for you!<br><br>
